# HousingSimulator

Simulator of a home controlled by interconnected domotics components. The simulator includes areas of the home, which have properties such as temperature, light, among others. These are monitored by sensors, which provide the readings to rules managed by rule processors that determine what actions to take based on the sensor readings. In the areas, there are also devices that affect the properties of the zone where they are located and respond to commands issued by the rule processors. The simulator is controlled by commands written by the user. The simulator includes the concept of time passage. The passage of time in the simulator is entirely independent of the real time measured by the computer, being described in abstract units of "moments," and advances to the next moment by user command.
